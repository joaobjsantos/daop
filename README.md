# DAOP - Data Augmentation Optimizer

DAOP is a framework for data augmentation optimization using pytorch, and its instantiation for Self-Supervised Learning, DAOP4SSL, is implemented on this repository. 

In order to execute the framework, please create a conda environment with the dependencies in the [conda_env_full.yml](conda_env_full.yml) file:

```bash
conda env create -f conda_env_full.yml
```

To execute the framework for the Pretext Optimization (PO) experiment, please run the following commands:

```bash
conda activate daop
python main_po.py {seeds separated by commas}
```

To execute the framework for the Downstream Optimization (DO) experiment, please run the following commands:

```bash
conda activate daop
python main_do.py {seeds separated by commas}
```

To execute the framework for the Simultaenous Pretext and Downstream Optimization (DO) experiment, please run the following commands:

```bash
conda activate daop
python main_spdo.py {seeds separated by commas}
```

To execute the framework for the Supervised Learning (SL) experiment, please run the following commands:

```bash
conda activate daop
python main_sl.py {seeds separated by commas}
```

The results will be saved in the predefined folder set in the configuration of each experiment.

The framework is easily customizable by changing the configuration in the `configs` folder, which can be done by creating a new configuration file inheriting from the base configuration file with the desired changes, and it is possible to include custom functions to replace each of the parts of the pipeline.
